  abstract = {Problem decomposition plays an essential role in the success of cooperative co-evolution (CC), when used for solving large-scale optimization problems. The recently proposed recursive differential grouping (RDG) method has been shown to be very efficient, especially in terms of time complexity. However, it requires an appropriate parameter setting to estimate a threshold value in order to determine if two subsets of decision variables interact or not. Furthermore, using one global threshold value may be insufficient to identify variable interactions in components with different contribution to the fitness value. Inspired by the different grouping 2 (DG2) method, in this paper, we adaptively estimates a threshold value based on computational round-off errors for RDG. We derive an upper bound of the round-off errors, which is shown to be sufficient when identifying variable interactions across a wide range of large-scale benchmark problems. Comprehensive numerical experimental results showed that the proposed RDG2 method achieved higher decomposition accuracy than RDG and DG2. When embedded into a CC framework, it achieved statistically equal or significantly better solution quality than RDG and DG2, when used to solve the benchmark problems.},

  abstract = {Cooperative coevolution (CC) provides a powerful divide-and-conquer architecture for large scale global optimization (LSGO). However, its performance relies highly on decomposition. To make near-optimal decomposition, most developed decomposition strategies either cannot obtain the correct interdependency information or require a lot of fitness evaluations (FEs) in the identification. To alleviate the limitations in previous works, in this paper we propose a fast interdependency identification (FII) algorithm for CC in LSGO. The proposed algorithm firstly identifies separable and nonseparable variables efficiently. Then, the interdependency information of nonseparable variables is further investigated. To make near-optimal decomposition for CC, our algorithm avoids the necessity of obtaining the full interdependency information of nonseparable variables. Therefore, a significant number of FEs can be saved. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two suites of LSGO benchmark functions with up to 2000 variables. FII correctly identified the interdependency information on most benchmark functions with much fewer FEs in comparison with three state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, combined with CC and coupled with a differential evolution variant serving as the optimizer, FII has shown its promising performance in LSGO.}

  abstract = {Cooperative co-evolution is a framework that can be used to effectively solve large scale optimization problems. This approach employs a divide and conquer strategy, which decomposes the problem into sub-components that are optimized separately. However, solution quality relies heavily on the decomposition method used. Ideally, the interacting decision variables should be assigned to the same sub-component and the interdependency between sub-components should be kept to a minimum. Differential grouping, a recently proposed method, has high decomposition accuracy across a suite of benchmark functions. However, we show that differential grouping can only identify decision variables that interact directly. Subsequently, we propose an extension of differential grouping that is able to correctly identify decision variables that also interact indirectly. Empirical studies show that our extended differential grouping method achieves perfect decomposition on all of the benchmark functions investigated. Significantly, when our decomposition method is embedded in the cooperative co-evolution framework, it achieves comparable or better solution quality than the differential grouping method.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a competitive divide-and-conquer algorithm for solving large-scale black-box optimization problems for which there are thousands of decision variables and the algebraic models of the problems are unavailable. We focus on problems that are partially additively separable, since this type of problem can be further decomposed into a number of smaller independent subproblems. The proposed algorithm addresses two important issues in solving large-scale black-box optimization: (1) the identification of the independent subproblems without explicitly knowing the formula of the objective function and (2) the optimization of the identified black-box subproblems. First, a Global Differential Grouping (GDG) method is proposed to identify the independent subproblems. Then, a variant of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) is adopted to solve the subproblems resulting from its rotation invariance property. GDG and CMA-ES work together under the cooperative co-evolution framework. The resultant algorithm, named CC-GDG-CMAES, is then evaluated on the CEC’2010 large-scale global optimization (LSGO) benchmark functions, which have a thousand decision variables and black-box objective functions. The experimental results show that, on most test functions evaluated in this study, GDG manages to obtain an ideal partition of the index set of the decision variables, and CC-GDG-CMAES outperforms the state-of-the-art results. Moreover, the competitive performance of the well-known CMA-ES is extended from low-dimensional to high-dimensional black-box problems.},

  abstract = {Center particle swarm optimization algorithm (CenterPSO) is proposed where a center particle is incorporated into linearly decreasing weight particle swarm optimization (LDWPSO). Unlike other ordinary particles in LDWPSO, the center particle has no explicit velocity, and is set to the center of the swarm at every iteration. Other aspects of the center particle are the same as that of the ordinary particle, such as fitness evaluation and competition for the best particle of the swarm. Because the center of the swarm is a promising position, the center particle generally gets good fitness value. More importantly, due to frequent appearance as the best particle of swarm, it often attracts other particles and guides the search direction of the whole swarm. CenterPSO and LDWPSO are extensively compared on three well-known benchmark functions with 10, 20, 30 dimensions. Experimental results show that CenterPSO achieves not only better solutions but also faster convergence. Furthermore, CenterPSO and LDWPSO are compared as neural network training algorithms. The results show that CenterPSO achieves better performance than LDWPSO.}

Widely used benchmark functions and four types of experiments demonstrate that the proposed UPS uses slightly more computational time than PSO to attain significantly higher efficiency and, usually, better solution effectiveness and consistency than PSO. Robust performance was further demonstrated by the significantly higher efficiency and better solution effectiveness and stability achieved by the UPS, as compared to the PSO and its variants. Outstandingly, convergence speeds for the proposed UPS were very good on the 13 benchmark functions examined in experiment 1, demonstrating the correct movement of UPS particles toward convergence.}

Based on that, we recommend a set of simple, yet safe and robust non-parametric tests for statistical comparisons of classifiers: the Wilcoxon signed ranks test for comparison of two classifiers and the Friedman test with the corresponding post-hoc tests for comparison of more classifiers over multiple data sets. Results of the latter can also be neatly presented with the newly introduced CD (critical difference) diagrams.},

In this paper, we will discuss the basics and give a survey of a complete set of nonparametric procedures developed to perform both pairwise and multiple comparisons, for multi-problem analysis. The test problems of the CEC’2005 special session on real parameter optimization will help to illustrate the use of the tests throughout this tutorial, analyzing the results of a set of well-known evolutionary and swarm intelligence algorithms. This tutorial is concluded with a compilation of considerations and recommendations, which will guide practitioners when using these tests to contrast their experimental results.}

  abstract = "{This paper presents the linkage identification by non-monotonicity detection (LIMD) procedure and its extension for overlapping functions by introducing the tightness detection (TD) procedure. The LIMD identifies linkage groups directly by performing order-2 simultaneous perturbations on a pair of loci to detect monotonicity/non-monotonicity of fitness changes. The LIMD can identify linkage groups with at most order of k when it is applied to O(2k) strings. The TD procedure calculates tightness of linkage between a pair of loci based on the linkage groups obtained by the LIMD. By removing loci with weak tightness from linkage groups, correct linkage groups are obtained for overlapping functions, which were considered difficult for linkage identification procedures.}",
